# Tell me about how you...
Use this *open-ended* question prompt to encourage an accurate and detailed walkthrough of current behaviors.  You'll want to *abstract up a level* so that you're asking about a general behavior area rather than a specific task.

## Examples

 > "**Tell me about how** you measure what's going on with your business today..."
 
Suppose you were trying to build more useful web analytics software.  You ask about 'measuring their business' instead of 'using web analytics', which increases the likelihood that they'll tell you about their **current** metrics behavior instead of their **aspirational** "I _should_ be doing this" metrics behaviors.

> "**Tell me about how** you get your household fed today..."

You might think you want to build a subscription grocery service.  If you only asked specifically about grocery shopping, though, the participant might not tell you about ordering takeout, eating in a restaurant, or getting catered lunches at the office.




## Why this works
"Tell me about" invites the participant to *remember and recount* how they go through a process or action.  It gives permission to give a *longer, more thorough answer*; that rambling a bit is okay.

By comparison, asking directly "How do you do X?" is very direct. It sounds like you should give a short, definitive answer!  

Try saying each out loud - "Tell me about how you do X...?" vs. "How do you do X?" and you'll likely feel the difference.

Listen to how they reply - confident or hesitant?  You can often gauge their maturity/savvy level through their tone and/or body language.

Starting with a broader/more abstract area allows the participant to start talking about what is highest priority to them. It's more useful to know what is important *to your prospective customer* than to ask possibly-irrelevant questions about what is important *to you*.
