# How to Contribute
üëãüèΩ Hi, and thanks for wanting to make this set of questions *even more* useful and powerful!

This project's goals:
- Find and share *the most effective* questions for learning about customers' pain points, current behaviors, motivations, constraints, and decision-making
- Localize!  These questions are in English, and they've largely been field-tested where @cindyalvarez has worked or worked with teams - in the US, UK, India, Germany, Australia, Denmark, Sweden, and South Africa.  I'd welcome both language translations as well as localized variations that've worked better for you.
- Be kind: we're all learning.  Follow the contributor's code of conduct, please.

## Pull Request Guidelines
Please include the following in any pull requests:
- **Translation: yes/no** (if yes, which language?)
- **When has this variation/change been more effective for you?** (describe the environment/customer you've used it with)
