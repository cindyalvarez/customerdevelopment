# How to Contribute
üëãüèΩ Hi, and thanks for wanting to make this set of questions *even more* useful and powerful!

This project's goals:
- Find and share *the most effective* questions for learning about customers' pain points, current behaviors, motivations, constraints, and decision-making
- Localize!  These questions are in English, and they've largely been field-tested where @cindyalvarez has worked or worked with teams - in the US, UK, India, Germany, Australia, Denmark, Sweden, and South Africa.  I'd welcome both language translations as well as localized variations that've worked better for you.
- Be kind: we're all learning.  Follow the [contributor's code of conduct](https://github.com/cindyalvarez/customerdevelopment/edit/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please.

## Pull Request Guidelines
Please only submit new questions or suggested changes when you have direct and personal experience that they work.  You've asked them with real customers, who have responded positively and with substantive responses.  We're interested in questions that are effective in practice, not just in theory.

Please include the following in any pull requests:
- **Translation: yes/no** (if yes, which language?)
- **When has this variation/change been more effective for you?** (describe the environment/customer you've used it with)
