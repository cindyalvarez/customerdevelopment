# Customer Development Questions
Humans have different skills, motivations, and needs; they work in different industries.  And also, we all have human brains - which means that the same questions are effective across a variety of contexts.  These are the questions I ask in almost every interview.  Use them, suggest changes, remix them.  If you find a variation that works particularly well, please suggest it!  

## Getting Started
You can use one or all of these questions, as part of a formal customer interview or sprinkled into your existing customer conversations.
If you have not established the practice of talking with customers regularly, [some of these tips](https://www.cindyalvarez.com/3-ways-to-kickstart-customer-development-thinking-in-less-than-5-minutes/) may help kickstart you.

### Prerequisites
None!  Though if you'd like to learn more about customer development, you can read my book [*Lean Customer Development: Build Products Your Customers Will Buy*](http://amzn.to/2GseseG) - not open source, though it's likely free to borrow from your local public library.

## Contributing
Some questions work better with local or jargon-specific variations.  I welcome changes and variations - please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/cindyalvarez/customerdevelopment/edit/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on the code of conduct and how to submit your pull requests.
