# What's the most frustrating element of [topic]?

*Abstract up a level* to ask about a general topic or area, as opposed to a specific problem or part of a process.  This question helps identify opportunity areas that the customer may not realize are possible or may not be able to articulate.

## Examples

> **What's the most frustrating element of** coordinating childcare during non-school times?

 > "Thinking across your team's whole software development process, **what's the most frustrating part?** 
 


## Variations
> "**What part of** eating healthy **do you find the most likely to get stuck on?**

> "**Of all the steps in** consolidating stakeholder feedback, **which step do you dread the most?**


## Why this works
People are sometimes reluctant to complain about a work process (what if it makes them look bad? what if it makes their company look less competent?) 

You're giving the participant **explicit permission to complain** - *the most* implies that you know there is at least one frustrating aspect.  

This can also unlock opportunity areas in a process that the customer sees as 'good enough' already (or doesn't know how to fix).  Think: DVRs, Uber.
