# If you could wave a magic wand and change anything about [topic] -- *doesn't have to be possible* -- what would make your life easier?
You'll want to *abstract up a level* and ask about a more general topic, not a specific problem.
This question is long - and if you try to shorten it, you'll get oversimplified, non-useful answers.  Ask it towards the end of a conversation, *after* you've built some rapport with your prospective customer.

## Examples

 > "**If you could wave a magic wand and change anything about** commuting on public transit **-- *doesn't have to be possible* -- what would make your life easier**?"
 
"Impossible" answers are often a more honest look at the participant's biggest pain points.

 > "**If you could wave a magic wand and change anything about** eating healthy **-- *doesn't have to be possible* -- what would it bed**?"



## Why this works
Humans hate to look foolish, and sometimes that causes us to restrain our complaints.  Sometimes it pushes us to suggest something we know is possible, even if we don't think it'll be particularly helpful.  [Sometimes we are so convinced that a problem is unfixable that we don't bother to talk about it.](https://twitter.com/cindyalvarez/status/1438994281801207808?s=20)

Saying *magic wand* is a little silly, and that's deliberate. It invites the participant to step out of their professional identity for a second.

Emphasizing *it doesn't have to be possible* reassures the participant that you won't laugh at their suggestion.  They often know they aren't a subject matter expert on public transit, or nutrition, and this framing gives them permission to focus on *what they wish they could do* or *how they wish they could feel*.

Sometimes people shorten this question to ["If you could wave a magic wand, what would you want [in topic]?](https://twitter.com/cindyalvarez/status/1395419901607641088?s=20)" - this seemingly small change renders the question practically useless.  Asking 'what customers want' is a waste of time. It nudges them to talk about solutions instead of the root problem.
