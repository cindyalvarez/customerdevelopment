# If [problem] were magically solved already, how would it make your life better?

Sometimes this question fits into the conversation more naturally than the ["what other workarounds have you used to solve this?"](what-other-workarounds.md) question.  

Sometimes you'll need to ask both questions to learn enough about how the prospective customer prioritizes this problem. 

## Examples

> **If** the inability to limit frequency of customer contacts **were magically solved already, how would it make your life easier?**

This question helps you dig into vague value propositions like 'saves time' or 'saves money' to learn if there's tangible value worth solving for.

 > "**If you were already able to** consolidate feedback from internal and external stakeholders, **how would that make your life better?**
 


## Variations
> ...solved already, **how would it make your job easier?**

> ...solved already, **what would that allow you to do that you can't do today?** 

## Why this works
Some people think more in terms of potential gains than pain points - so asking about workarounds or what frustrates them will yield vague answers.  This question allows them to express their desired end-state -- *I want to be a person who can do X / who feels Y.*

Also: people often ask for solutions that will *save time, save money*, or *be easier*.  And also, an incremental savings of time, money, or error reduction doesn't always translate into something valuable.  

For example, a daily workflow that is 5 minutes faster - it's unlikely that saving that 5 minutes can unlock new possibilities.  5 minutes is about long enough to play a game on your phone. Would you pay money to be able to play one extra game of Angry Birds per day?
