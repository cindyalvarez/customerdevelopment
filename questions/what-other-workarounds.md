# What other workarounds have you used to try and solve for [problem]?
This is **the most effective** question for separating the *"motivated and willing to overcome friction to solve this** pain points from the *gee, it'd be nice to have* complaints.

Where there are workarounds, there is motivation (which usually translates to willingness to spend money/time/effort).

## Examples

 > "**What other workarounds have you tried to solve this problem of** consolidating feedback from internal and external stakeholders?
 

 > "Since we don't currently support this type of limit, **how have you managed to get around the problem of** ensuring that customers don't receive multiple emails in a short timespan?
 
When customers complain about a feature gap, start by acknowledging the lack ("you're right, we don't have that today") to build trust. 

## Why this works
There's a big gap between *what we'll actually do/use* and *what we aspirationally wish we could do*.  A lot of startups have died after building aspirational 'sure, I'd use that!' products that no one bought.  

Asking about workarounds helps you learn about the prospective customer's motivation.   If they're already investing in some type of solution, it must be important to them!  If they aren't - *"well, we can't do anything until you fix X"* - then the consequences of not solving the problem can't be that painful.

**If there isn't a workaround, it isn't a problem that needs to be solved.**

Note: workarounds are often slow, error-prone, messy, or otherwise embarrassing to talk about. You may need to gently prompt the customer, or else they won't realize that yes, you DID want to hear about their workflow is built on Post-It notes, the reminder app on their phone, and forwarding emails.
