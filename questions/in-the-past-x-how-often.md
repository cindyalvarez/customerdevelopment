# In the past [time period], how often has [problem] happened?
Once your customer has mentioned a pain point, use this follow-up question to start understanding frequency (through continued follow-up questions), severity.

## Examples

 > "**In the past** week, about **how many times has** it been difficult to find a specific message on Slack?
 
Use your intuition to pick a relevant timeframe - shorter for smaller, lower-impact problems; longer for higher-impact problems.<br>

 > "**In the past** month or two, **how often have you ordered last-minute food delivery because you were out of groceries?**



## Why this works
We have stronger memories for events that happened recently - it's called [recency bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recency_bias).  

Asking this question helps us to understand how much of a customer's answer is just because *it just happened* versus *it's really important to me*.   It also helps to focus your customer on a specific incident instead of a blurry average of 'all the times X has happened'.

It also tees up some great follow-up questions, like *"So this happened about a month ago.  Has this been happening about once a month, or...?"* or *"I see, this happened last quarter. Thinking back, how much trouble did this cause when it happened last?*
