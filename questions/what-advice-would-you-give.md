# What advice would you give to a friend (peer, coworker) getting started with...?
This question helps participants think back to problems they may have long-ago solved.  It can feel socially awkward to talk about mistakes made or confusing concepts, but framing it as 'giving advice' makes it feel okay.

## Examples

 > "**What advice would you give to a new hire** getting their dev environment set up?"
 
By leaving this open-ended, the participant will naturally talk about what was most important to *them* - whether that's a software setting or cultural encouragement.

> "**What advice would you give to a friend** deciding between apartments?

## Why this works
"What advice would you give..." motivates the participant to be helpful rather than to 'not look foolish'.  This means they give more complete and honest answers, and think through and talk about *how to approach a decision*, as opposed to making suggestions.

We tend to want to ask about preferences ("which do you like better?") -- and also, you can't extrapolate much from personal preferences. (That's why we call them *personal* preferences!)

When we ask people to give advice, they are revealing a lot about their mental models: the questions they ask, the tradeoffs they balance, how they get started.  Mental models are shared within a specific customer segment.
