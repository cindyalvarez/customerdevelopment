# Last time you did [task], what was the most frustrating part?
Use this *open-ended* question prompt to learn about pain points or friction in an existing behavior or workflow.  

## Examples

 > "**Last time you** tried to find a contractor for home repairs, **what was the most frustrating part**?"
 
If you're learning about the contractor problem space, you want to know about personally-experienced frustrations (as opposed to stereotypical problems or things they've heard second-hand).

> "**Last time you** had to find care/activities during summer for a school-aged kid, **what did you find most frustrating**?"

Suppose you were building an activity finder for busy parents. You'd be tempted to ask about how parents selected activities, which might cause you to miss higher-priority pain points. (Perhaps they are more motivated to solve cost, pick-up times, or safety issues!) 

## Variations
(instead of "what was the most frustrating part")

#### "...how long did it take?" 

> **Last time you** sent out a marketing email campaign, **how long did it take?**

#### "...who was involved?"

> **Last time your team** experienced a security incident, **who was involved** in getting things back under control?

## Why this works
Humans remember historical behaviors; we invent present and future behaviors.

We are more accurate when remembering and talking about something in the past, versus present or future.  This is often unintentional. Without realizing it, when talking "what we do", we tend to blend together multiple incidents; when talking about "what we would do", we tend to be very aspirational / talk about what we wish we could do.

Asking about "the most frustrating" gives the participant 'permission' to complain.  By saying 'the most frustrating' you're admitting that you know something was frustrating regardless of how polite or how competent your participant is.  Similarly, asking "how long did it take" implies that you know it might've been a long time.

Starting with a broader/more abstract area allows the participant to start talking about what is highest priority to them. It's more useful to know what is important *to your prospective customer* than to ask possibly-irrelevant questions about what is important *to you*.
