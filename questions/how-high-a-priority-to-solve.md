# How high a priority is it for you to solve [problem]?

Every human has annoyances - sometimes major ones - that, nonetheless, we aren't motivated to fix.  We'll complain, and also not spend $2 or 10 minutes to get rid of the problem.  You don't want to 'solve' these problems!

## Examples

> **How high a priority is it for you to solve the problem of** last-minute ordering delivery for dinner?

If the customers answers "high priority", then your next question should be some version of [what other workarounds have you used to try and solve this?](what-other-workarounds.md)

 > "**How high a priority is** healthy eating **for you to improve?** 
 


## Variations
> "**Where does [problem] fall in your list of top priorities to fix?  Top 3? Top 5?"**


## Why this works
Fixing any problem - whether the solution requires money, time, learning something new or changing a habit - requires tradeoffs.   Your prospective customer can't fix everything, and it's often not worth the friction involved to fix lower-priority pain points. 

That doesn't mean that people won't complain about them, though!  It's not uncommon for someone to spend 15 minutes complaining about something, only to ask them this question and have them admit that it doesn't even make their Top 20 of problems.
