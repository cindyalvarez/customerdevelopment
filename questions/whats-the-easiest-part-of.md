# What's the easiest part about [topic]?

Some people are uncomfortable talking about pain points or challenges early in a conversation.  Asking about what is working can help them to feel more comfortable talking (and also help you understand the types of solutions that are effective for this customer.  *Abstract up a level* to ask about a general topic or area, as opposed to a specific problem or part of a process.  

## Examples

> **What's the easiest part of** coordinating childcare during non-school times?

 > "Thinking across your team's whole software development process, **what step do you worry the least about?** 
 


## Variations
> "**What part of** staying healthy **do you find easiest to fit into your routine?**

> "**Of all the steps in** consolidating stakeholder feedback, **which step goes the *most* smoothly?**


## Why this works
People are sometimes reluctant to complain about a work process (what if it makes them look bad? what if it makes their company look less competent?) 
By starting with *what's working*, you can lower their defenses and help them feel more comfortable talking with you.  Also, the elements that work can hint at potential solutions - is the "thing that works" easy because it's automated? Because it leverages positive social pressure? Because errors are easy to avoid and correct?  

Once you've asked this question and let the participant talk about the positives, it is easier to get them to talk about pain points and challenges.
